**Describe the bug**

Give us your best attempt to communicate the issue you're having. If you don't know how to articulate it, you can give us a link to any kind of recording that helps reveal it.

We can take a look and figure it out from there. The more detail you can give  us, in whatever medium works for you, the better.

**To Reproduce**

Make sure your report specifically says or somehow points out exactly how we might be able to reproduce this on our side. In Physics that can be a very loaded question so just think in terms of how many slots you were writing to / reading from at once and any notes about write velocity / acceleration through the failure window (as can possibly be correlated to CPU cache thresholds). We realize it's difficult to explain outside of the context of the experiment. 

If you're doing other kinds of work where the code is all that's needed, please share the code that you can to reproduce (or at least steps / compiler options, etc). Think about what you would need to help someone with something you know well.

** What could Splinter do better? **

Even if it's just how it reported an error or perhaps didn't, feedback about the process of how it broke for you is very helpful to us. 

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
