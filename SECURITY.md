# Security Policy

Any version of Splinter from `1.0.0` onward is supported. Due to the 
nature of Splinter there will likely be very few issues that require
responsible disclosure, but please reach out to me at:

`timthepost@protonmail.com`

If you find something that you think could make someone using Splinter
in production vulnerable to mishap or bad actors. I usually respond as
soon as I can to urgent things like that, but please give me a day or
two as I am disabled.
