Here's how to get up and running quickly!

## Downloading, Building &amp; Installing

Splinter assumes a Linux/GNU setup of some sort; while it's built and tested on 
Debian (latest) with `build-essential` installed. By design, Splinter limits 
external dependencies to eliminate supply chain attacks. If you want to use 
the tighter-coupling with Valgrind for tests (recommended), then you'll also 
need `valgrind-dev` or whatever gets you `<valgrind/valgrind.h>`.

### Install from git (recommended)

Clone the repository using git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/timthepost/libsplinter
```

Then go to `libsplinter/` and make any modifications you want to `config.h` 
(just take a look at the file) and then run `make`. 

Once done, you can run `make test` and ultimately `sudo make install`. I commit
urgent fixes to `main`, everything else goes to `splinter-devel` and gets merged
with each release.

If you intend to use the library in production, I recommend going with git.

### Install from release tarball

You can download a `.tar.gz` file from [the GitHub release page](https://github.com/timthepost/libsplinter/releases)
and extract it wherever it's convenient. Follow the build instructions from there. 

To upgrade, you'll need to repeat the process. Unless you have a specific reason 
to prefer the snapshots, I recommend using git instead.

### Deploy On Deno Deploy

Just make sure you've copied the shared objects and bindings to your repo and deploy.

There are some limitations.
