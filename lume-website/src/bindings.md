# Splinter Foreign Language Bindings for FFI

Splinter ships with the following:

- TypeScript (Deno/Bun) FFI definitions with a universal class included
- Rust (In-memory)
- Rust (Persistent)

Python and Java users can load the shared objects using whichever method works
best (both languages offer multiple routes).

If you get Splinter working outside of Rust or TS, drop a line and let us know
and share your setup if you can!
