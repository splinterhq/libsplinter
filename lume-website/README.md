# Splinter's Lume Site

This is the best I could do at a dark-themed site that didn't
hurt my eyes (and other people's eyes) to look at. Unfortunately,
I lack the design skills to do a light version, or organize 
the massive amount of information there is to convey about splinter
in a few paragraphs.

## Help Wanted

The BBS colors were intentional, but please consider the current site
to be a work-in-progress, and please be my editor instead of being
my critic. Each thing Splinter does extremely well is also extremely
important to me on a personal level, so it's difficult to prioritize
exposure to it in a way that puts the user ahead of my own excitement.

LLMs are even worse at this than I am, or the content would be much
better. If you were about to say it already looks generated, I accept
the sort-of compliment, but it's (almost all) mine.

## Starting

Deno users can just type `deno task serve`.

I'm not sure how that translates to Bun or Node (there's only a `deno.json` present).

Can't you almost hear the modem screaching, though? `:)`
