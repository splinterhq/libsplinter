## `splinter_event_bus_wait` Splinter API Reference

The purpose of `splinter_event_bus_wait` is to block until the global epoch changes or a timeout expires, using `poll(2)` + `read(2)` on the fd from `splinter_event_bus_open`.

### Forward Declaration & Use

`int splinter_event_bus_wait(int fd, uint64_t timeout_ms)` `<splinter.h>`

```
int fd = splinter_event_bus_open();
if (splinter_event_bus_wait(fd, 1000) == 0) {
    uint64_t dirty[SPLINTER_EVENT_BUS_MASK_WORDS];
    splinter_event_bus_get_dirty(dirty, SPLINTER_EVENT_BUS_MASK_WORDS);
}
```

### Return & Rationale

**Return Behavior:**
Returns 0 if a change was detected, or -1 on timeout or error. `timeout_ms` of 0 is non-blocking and `UINT64_MAX` waits forever. On return the eventfd counter has been drained.

**Errno Behavior:**
CONFIDENCE_TOO_LOW_FOR_GENERATION

**Rationale (Or None):**
After a successful wait the caller should call `splinter_event_bus_get_dirty` to find which slots changed, scanning only what moved instead of sweeping the whole store. Prefer this over a busy spin whenever you can afford to block.
